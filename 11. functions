Function: 
Functions are block of code that perform a specific function, these block of code i.e. function can be used again and again.
Indentation matters in python while writing function.

E.g:
def greet():
  print("Hello, World!")

def say_goodbye():
  print("Good bye, till we meet next time!")

greet()
say_goodbye()

Output:
Hello, World!
Good bye, till we meet next time!


Function Declaration:
Just like variables needs to be defined before we can use them. Similarly the function needs to be defined before we can use them.


E.g:
print_number(5)

def print_number(n):
  print(n)

Output:
ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<main.py>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'print_number' is not defined


E.g:
def print_number(n):
  print(n)
  
print_number(5)

Output:
5
