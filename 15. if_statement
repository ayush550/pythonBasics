if else are conditional statements which gets excecuted depending upon the value of condition which is either True or False.
These are used for executing a specific block of code in programming.

if Statement: if is the most simple conditional statement, if the condition is true, the block of code gets executed.
e.g:
i = 9
if i<10:
  print("number is Less than Ten")

if...else statement: It is a control statement that helps in decision-making based on specific conditions. 
When the if condition is False. If the condition in the if statement is not true, the else block will be executed.

e.g:
i = 5
if i>0:
  print("Number is positive")
else:
  print("Number is negative")

if...elif...else statement: if-elif-else statement in Python is used for multi-way decision-making. 
This allows us to check multiple conditions sequentially and execute a specific block of code when a condition is True. 
If none of the conditions are true, the else block is executed.

e.g:
i = 20
if i%2 == 0:
  print("Number is divisible by 2")
elif i%3 == 0:
  print("Number is divisible by 3")
elif i%5 == 0:
  print("Number is divisible by 5")
else:
  print("Number is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5")
