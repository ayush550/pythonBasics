In python a single variable's type can change throughout the code. This is called dynamic typing.
Eg: the following code runs without any errors:

variable = 10          #int type
variable = "Hello"    #string type
variable = [1, 2, 3]  #list type

Not all languages support dynamic typing e.g: In C++ or Java this code will give an error: incompatible types

int variable = 10;
variable = "Hello";  //Error: incompatible types

Exercise:
variable = 10      
print(type(variable))
variable = "Hello"   
print(type(variable))
variable = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(variable))

output:
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'list'>
