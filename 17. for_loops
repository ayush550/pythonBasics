Python For Loops are used for iterating over a sequence like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

e.g:

i = 0
for i in range(4):
    print(i, end = " ")
Output:
0 1 2 3

range() in python
e.g:
i = 2
for i in range(2, 5):
    print(i, end=" ")

Output:
2 3 4

# For loop steps
e.g:
i = 2
for i in range(2, 10, 3):  #here 3 is the step size
  print(i, end=" ")
Output:
2 5 8
