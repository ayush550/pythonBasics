Control flow refers to the order in which statements within a program execute.

Control Flow statement types:
1) conditional statement : if, if-else
2) looping statements : while loop, for loop
3) jump statement : break, continue, pass

# jump statement
1. break: Exits the loop immediately
2. continue: skips the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
3. pass: acts as a placeholder and does nothing. We cannot have empty loops, so we can use pass to avoid errors.

e.g:
for i in range(1, 10):
  pass

e.g:
for i in range(1, 8):
  if i == 3:
    continue
  elif i == 6:
    break
  print(i, end = " ")

Output:
1 2 4 5
