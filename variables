# Naming Convention
There are several naming conventions such as:
1. Camel Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word. Eg: myVariableName
2. Snake Case: Words are separated by underscores. Eg: my_variable_name
3. Pascal Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized. Eg: MyVariableName
In python, we generally use snake case.
